		<h1>What Are Graphic Novels?</h1>
		<p class="round orange-p">
			Since our online storefront specializes in some of the more odd types of reading material, it is best described a little bit. Graphic novels are fairly self-explanatory, novels with graphics! In a comic book style, they'll have panels but unlike comics, they often tell the same, ongoing story whereas comics can be episodic, ongoing or tell different iterations of the same story. Graphic novels are commonly seen in coloured and non-coloured formats, pretty interesting stuff. There can be action and there can be slice of life, anything is possible in the world of graphic novels! So, now that you have a good understanding of them, why don't you try a book to get you hooked!
