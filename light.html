		<h1 class="h1-alt">What Are Light Novels?</h1>
			
		<p class="round purple-p">Since our online storefront specializes in some of the more odd types of reading material, it is best described a little bit. Light novels are a form of literature from Japan and thus, reading in the traditional right to left format. They're very close to standard novels other than their length (being longer than novelettes yet shorter than novels) and the fact that, more often than not, they have illustrations scattered about them. They can tell a wide variety of stories but the two most common ones are romance stories and isekai (traveling to another world) stories! We have some of those very stories that we're sure you'll enjoy! So, now that you have a good understanding of them, why don't you try a book to get you hooked!</p>
			
		<h2>Toradora! By Yuyuko Takemiya</h1>
		<section class="wrapper round">
			
			<div class="text-box">
				
				<a href="toradora.html"><img class="round" src="images/toradorasmall.png" alt="Cover for the first volume of the light novel Toradora!."></a>
				<p>What happens when a mean looking student and a tiger clash? A funny, heartwarming, slice of life story of course! Written by Yuyuko Takemiya, this story is sure to catch your interest, especially if you're as feisty as one of the main characters Taiga "Tiger" Aisaka! Love flies in sparks here, so make sure that you've got your safety googles. And make sure that they're clear enough, so you can keep reading because you won't want to stop! Click on the book cover, so you can learn more!</p>

		<h2 class="h2-alt">Re:Zero By Tappei Nagatsuki</h2>
		<section class="wrapper-2 round">
			
			<div class="text-box-2">
				
				<a href="rezero.html"><img class="round" src="images/rezerosmall.png" alt="Cover for the first volume of the light novel Re:Zero."></a>
				<p>If dark fantasy is your thing, then Tappei Nagatsuki has got your back! To our main character Subaru, death means nothing... Other than the trauma that comes with it of course... He turns back to a random point in time after dying and must use this power forced upon him without telling anyone! This is a dark story, even meshing in some excellently done fantasy political drama! If that's something that tickles your fancy then click the book and learn some more!</p>

		<h2>Shield Hero By Aneko Yusagi</h2>
		<section class="wrapper round">
			
			<div class="text-box">
				
				<a href="shieldhero.html"><img class="round" src="images/shieldsmall.png" alt="Cover for the first volume of the light novel Shield Hero."></a>
				<p>Other worlds truly seem to be harsh! Although not as scary as the world of Re:Zero, it gets pretty close, especially for the main character and Shield Hero Naofumi. He is forced into, what is unequivocally, "the reject hero" and yet still forced to help save the fantasy world he has been transported into. He becomes cynical and softens up, this truly is a story full of emotions and the effects the world can have on someone! If that interests you then click on the book to learn more!</p>
