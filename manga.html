		<h1>What Is Manga?</h1>
			
		<p class="round orange-p">Since our online storefront specializes in some of the more odd types of reading material, it is best described a little bit. Manga is a type of literature not dissimilar to comic books, though there are two major differences. The first is that manga is read in the traditional Japanese format of right to left, meaning everything might be a little backwards to those of you who are English speakers. But, after a chapter or two, things won't feel any different from reading a comic book in that sense! The other difference is that manga is typically in black and white with the exception of some special exceptions, like the first chapter of a new series. Manga is great as it is extremely versatile in tone and artwork! There's romance and there's alternate history battles with other worldly creatures! So, now that you have a good understanding of it, why don't you try a book to get you hooked!</p>

		<section class="wrapper-2 round">
			
			<div class="text-box-2">
				
				<a href="csm.html"><img class="round" src="images/csmsmall.png" alt="Cover for the first volume of the manga series Chainsaw Man."></a>
				<p>Written and illustrated by the legendary and legendarily strange Tatsuki Fujimoto, Chainsaw Man is a story that'll keep you on your toes the entire time! If you wish to buy, learn more or just see how the webpage for it looks, then give the book cover a click, and it'll take you where you wish to go!</p>

		<h2>Maison Ikkoku By Rumiko Takahashi</h2>
		<section class="wrapper round">
			
			<div class="text-box">
				
				<a href="ikkoku.html"><img class="round" src="images/ikkokusmall.png" alt="Cover for the first volume of the manga series Maison Ikkoku."></a>
				
				<!-- &frac12 is the 1/2 fraction character -->
				<p>Rumiko Takahashi, known for her more unrealistic stories such as Urusei Yatsura, Ranma &frac12; and Inuyasha, takes all of the best grounded and slice of life elements from those stories (along with her own brand-new spice) and creates a new one titled Maison Ikkoku! With characters so real they feel like they'll pop out of the page, this is one slice of life story that you won't want to miss! Click the book, and you'll find out more about the story and the lovely woman on the cover!</p>

		<h2 class="h2-alt">Kaguya-sama By Aka Akasaka</h2>
		<section class="wrapper-2 round">
			
			<div class="text-box-2">
				
				<a href="kaguya.html"><img class="round" src="images/kaguyasmall.png" alt="Cover for the first volume of the manga series Kaguya-sama."></a>
				<p>Love is war! That's what the writer of Kaguya-sama, Aka Akasaka, has written into this story anyway! Read and you'll see two brainy high schoolers battle it out in psychological warfare where they try to make the other confess...? This is an odd piece but the things the titular Kaguya tries to do to make the apple of her eye confess will get you laughing up a storm! Click on the book, so you can learn more about the wonderful Kaguya Shinomiya!</p>
