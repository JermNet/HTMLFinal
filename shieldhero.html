				<h2>Shield Hero by Aneko Yusagi</h2>
				<p>
					Shield Hero a.k.a. The Rising of the Shield Hero, originally published as a web novel is now here for you in full, beautiful, printed pages! The story follows Naofumi Iwatani, an easygoing young man from Japan. After browsing his local library he finds a book which transports him to another world! At the same time, three other people are transported to the same world and the four are destined to become the world's four cardinal heroes. Each has their own weapon, except for Naofumi who gets the shield. Already off to a bad start, things only get worse as his companion designated to him by the king robs him and falsely accuses him of sexual assault. He is shunned by everyone and his easygoing demeanor turns cynical. From then on, Naofumi is untrusting of people but eventually meets someone who, although slowly, warms his newly frozen over heart. Although dark at times, Shield Hero is all about overcoming the odds, learning to trust again and never letting the worst of times take you down! If that interests you, this series is for you!
